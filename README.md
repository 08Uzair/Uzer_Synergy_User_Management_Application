## Overview
This application is designed to manage users using the JSONPlaceholder API. It implements CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations to interact with user data.

## Features
üí°Fetch Users: Display a list of users fetched from the JSONPlaceholder API, showing basic info like name, email, and phone.

üí°Create User: A form to create a new user, simulating a POST request to the API.

üí°Update User: Edit existing user details with pre-filled data, simulating a PUT request to the API.

üí°Delete User: Remove users with a DELETE request simulation.

#### Note : `POST` , `PUT` , `DELETE` methods are not supported by this JSONPlaceholder API. But I have implemented the logic for that .
